/*
üß† Logic Explanation (with Example)
Problem:
Find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Approach:
Use the sliding window technique with two pointers l and r.
 Track the last seen index of characters using an integer array of size 256 (ASCII range).
  If a character repeats within the window, move the left pointer to avoid it. 
  Calculate the current window size: r - l + 1 and update maxlen.
üîÅ Example: "abcabcbb"

| Step | Char | Left (l) | Right (r) | Window | maxlen |
| ---- | ---- | -------- | --------- | ------ | ------ |
| 1    | a    | 0        | 0         | "a"    | 1      |
| 2    | b    | 0        | 1         | "ab"   | 2      |
| 3    | c    | 0        | 2         | "abc"  | 3      |
| 4    | a    | 1        | 3         | "bca"  | 3      |
| 5    | b    | 2        | 4         | "cab"  | 3      |
| 6    | c    | 3        | 5         | "abc"  | 3      |
| 7    | b    | 5        | 6         | "cb"   | 3      |
| 8    | b    | 6        | 7         | "b"    | 3      |

‚û°Ô∏è Final Answer = 3 ("abc" is the longest substring without repeating characters)

‚è±Ô∏è Time & Space Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the string (each character is visited once by the right pointer and possibly once by the left pointer)

Space Complexity: O(1) (Using a fixed-size array of 256 for ASCII characters)
